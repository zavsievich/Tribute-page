            Of all of the cities in Europe, Amsterdam has to be the most unique,
            offering a culture and atmosphere that is totally different from
            that of most other major metropolises. The exact quality that makes
            the city so unique is hard to quantify,however it definitely has
            something to do with the freedom and relaxed atmosphere enjoyed by
            its residents.

              Although the history of Amsterdam is short by European standards –
              <span class="green-text">it started as a fishing village</span>
              back in the 13th century – it’s more than made up for by the shear
              wealth of architectural and cultural history that’s on display for
              all to see.Amsterdam can rival any city when it comes to beauty<br /><span

                >The role that Amsterdam played</span
              >
              as a centre of trade for Western Europe and beyond brought people
              here form all over the world.<br />This led to a diverse and
              liberal society that values artistic ability just as much as
              economic acumen and today boasts some of the most progressive and
              forward thinking laws and policies in the world.

              Amsterdam’s red light district is famous throughout the world for
              its nightlife and for window displays that leave little to the
              imagination.

              The culture of freedom that is found in Amsterdam is almost a
              self-fulfilling prophecy, as the more people who visit the city to
              take advantage of the relaxed atmosphere; the less likely it is
              that the status quo will change.

              Art in Holland and Amsterdam has always flourished and thrived and
              many of the world’s greatest painters hail from this tiny nation.
              The freedom of the city definitely encouraged at atmosphere of
              creativity and led to a society where artistic expression and
              experimentation was very much welcomed and seen as part of the
              culture of the city.

              Ask most people what they think of when they hear the name
              Amsterdam and many will say the cannabis friendly coffee shops
              that dot the city.And though cannabis is legal in the city, its
              use is carefully controlled and monitored with customers only able
              to smoke in specially licensed premises.
